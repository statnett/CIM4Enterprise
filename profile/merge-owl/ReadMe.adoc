In Autofos we have a multiple profile files set that is used to generated the C# SDK. I have attached the "merge-owl" file that is generated from link:https://cimtool.ucaiug.io/[CIMTool]. This is not the same as you can download from ENTSO-E website for CGMES v3.0 link:https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-conformity-and-interoperability/[(CIM Conformity and Interoperability (entsoe.eu))]. I am currently working on getting a version that is using the same RDFS and the new RDFS that should match the IEC 61970-501:Ed2.
